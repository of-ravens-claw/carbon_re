NFS Carbon coordinates for normally unaccessible areas
Taken from the Wii - may not match across versions (but that should be EXTREMELY unlikely.)

NOTE: These are not meant to be 100% precise - they will lead to a road at the place in question, and should be useful as a rough guide.

Format is X, Y, Z
Z is the height. Mostly important for canyons, since they're pretty high up.
Canyon coords are usually the start of the race.
Coordinates have been altered in order to look nicer.
